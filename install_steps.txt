1) SSH into your VPS and run this commands to clone the Github repository and begin installation:

sudo git clone https://github.com/MJFiuba/openvpn-server-install.git
cd openvpn-server-install
sudo openvpn-install.sh

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.
Notes:
Markup : * for most questions, the default answer will work just fine
         * the default port for OpenVPN is 1194 (UDP)
         * you current DNS server should work, but you can use 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) just in case
         * the config files for the server and client are placed in the root directory by default
         ** it is necessary to move it to your local user home directory and give it the correct priviledges
sudo mv /root/<client_name>.ovpn /home/<local_user_name>
chown <local_user_name> <client_name>.ovpn
         * you can disable the logs on the VPN server editing the config file /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf , and then restart the openvpn-server service.
