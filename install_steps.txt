OpenVPN road warrior installer for Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.
---------------------------------------------------------

1) SSH into your VPS and run this commands to clone the Github repository and begin installation:

sudo git clone https://github.com/MJFiuba/openvpn-server-install.git
cd openvpn-server-install
sudo bash openvpn-install.sh

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.
Notes:
* for most questions, the default answer will work just fine
* the default port for OpenVPN is 1194 (UDP)
* recommended to use 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) as your DNS server
* the config files for the server and client are placed in the root directory by default. It is necessary to move it to your local user home directory and give it the correct privileges
sudo mv /root/<client_name>.ovpn /home/<local_user_name>
chown <local_user_name> <client_name>.ovpn
* you can disable the logs on the VPN server editing the config file /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf , and then restart the openvpn-server service.

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

Now you should go to the client and download the .ovpn file (e.g. using SFTP) or transfer it from the server (e.g. using SCP)
